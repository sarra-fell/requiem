I wonder what that dysymbolia thing is all about???\nYou could also press X to skip though text if you want (feature pending). I don't know why you would want to though.\n\nHope you liked those 5 gems I gave you, they are very pretty. If you want more, try unlocking more theory pages! I explain what this theory tab is all about in the next page. You could read it if you want. Or you could just grab the gems and leave without reading it, not my place to judge.\n\n- Sarracenia"

You could also just never come back.\n\nThe point is, you could skip these and be fine, and you definitely don't have to read them in order. In the theory tab you are on right now, you unlock my write-ups in English (ugh, boring language right, Japanese is where its at) and you can read whichever ones you think will help, either way you can get cool rewards so its a win-win.\n\n You'll unlock write-ups about a variety of topics:\n - How to use certain game features and tips and tricks for using them.\n- The point behind the different aspects in the game and why they are designed the way they are for you to help you best learn Japanese, and tips and tricks for making the most out of them for your personal language learning journey.\n - How I suggest you learn Japanese in general.\n - My own explainations for basic grammar topics in Japanese in case you don't feel like finding a different resource for that which I may or may not help you find!\n - Plus more, probably?\n\nAlso at the bottom of the tab is a special section that can help you in the game if you don't know what to do next. You unlocked it by also unlocking this tab. At least, if I bothered to implement that yet lol.\n\n See you in the next one, or not!\n\n - Sarracenia"
