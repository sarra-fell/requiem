<!ELEMENT entry (ent_seq, k_ele*, r_ele+, sense+)>
        <!-- Entries consist of kanji elements, reading elements,
        general information and sense elements. Each entry must have at
        least one reading element and one sense element. Others are optional.

<!ELEMENT k_ele (keb, ke_inf*, ke_pri*)>
        <!-- The kanji element, or in its absence, the reading element, is
        the defining component of each entry.
        The overwhelming majority of entries will have a single kanji
        element associated with a word in Japanese. Where there are
        multiple kanji elements within an entry, they will be orthographical
        variants of the same word, either using variations in okurigana, or
        alternative and equivalent kanji. Common "mis-spellings" may be
        included, provided they are associated with appropriate information
        fields. Synonyms are not included; they may be indicated in the
        cross-reference field associated with the sense element.

<!ELEMENT keb (#PCDATA)>
        <!-- This element will contain a word or short phrase in Japanese
        which is written using at least one non-kana character (usually kanji,
        but can be other characters). The valid characters are
        kanji, kana, related characters such as chouon and kurikaeshi, and
        in exceptional cases, letters from other alphabets.
        -->
<!ELEMENT ke_inf (#PCDATA)>
        <!-- This is a coded information field related specifically to the
        orthography of the keb, and will typically indicate some unusual
        aspect, such as okurigana irregularity.
        -->
<!ELEMENT ke_pri (#PCDATA)>
        <!-- This and the equivalent re_pri field are provided to record
        information about the relative priority of the entry,  and consist
        of codes indicating the word appears in various references which
        can be taken as an indication of the frequency with which the word
        is used. This field is intended for use either by applications which
        want to concentrate on entries of  a particular priority, or to
        generate subset files.
        The current values in this field are:
        - news1/2: appears in the "wordfreq" file compiled by Alexandre Girardi
        from the Mainichi Shimbun. (See the Monash ftp archive for a copy.)
        Words in the first 12,000 in that file are marked "news1" and words
        in the second 12,000 are marked "news2".
        - ichi1/2: appears in the "Ichimango goi bunruishuu", Senmon Kyouiku
        Publishing, Tokyo, 1998.  (The entries marked "ichi2" were
        demoted from ichi1 because they were observed to have low
        frequencies in the WWW and newspapers.)
        - spec1 and spec2: a small number of words use this marker when they
        are detected as being common, but are not included in other lists.
        - gai1/2: common loanwords, based on the wordfreq file.
        - nfxx: this is an indicator of frequency-of-use ranking in the
        wordfreq file. "xx" is the number of the set of 500 words in which
        the entry can be found, with "01" assigned to the first 500, "02"
        to the second, and so on. (The entries with news1, ichi1, spec1, spec2
        and gai1 values are marked with a "(P)" in the EDICT and EDICT2
        files.)

        The reason both the kanji and reading elements are tagged is because
        on occasions a priority is only associated with a particular
        kanji/reading pair.
